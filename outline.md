An engagement

Three ship resources:

- Speed
- Range
- Offense
- Defense

Speed

Position and movement is powerful.

The fleet with a speed greater than that of another fleet can force an engagement with that fleet. A faster ship can catch a ship of lower speed. If fleets have equal speed than neither fleet can force an engagement, but if both fleets are set for engagement then they can have an engagement.

Certain strategic positions are immobile. Thus an attack on these positions forces the holder of the position to engage.

The fleet with greater speed has the advantage of being able to choose where to engage. The attacker with the same speed can only engage strategic positions.

Range

Range is how far the offense of a fleet can reach. If the range of one fleet is greater than the range of the other it can attack without a response. If an fleet has greater range and speed it can engage without response.

Offense

Defense
